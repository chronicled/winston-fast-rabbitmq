# winston-fast-rabbitmq

A RabbitMQ transport for Winston 3.0.

Forked from [https://github.com/TBear79/winston-fast-rabbitmq](https://github.com/TBear79/winston-fast-rabbitmq)

It closes the connection after every message, but keeps the connection open as long as new messages arrive within a short timespan.

* Easy to use and fast to implement
* Build using [amqplib](https://www.npmjs.com/package/amqplib)
* Non-blocking as it uses [rabbit-chatter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rabbit-chatter)

# Usage

Use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install the module:

```
	npm install winston-fast-rabbitmq
```

Then use `require()` to load it in your code:

```javascript
	var winstonFastRabbitMq = require('winston-fast-rabbitmq');
```

Setup the transport in winston:

```javascript
    var options = {
        amqp: {
            // rabbit-chatter options
        },
        // winston options
    }
	winston.add(winston.transports.WinstonFastRabbitMq(options));
```

Now you are ready to send some logs to RabbitMq!

## Options

Most options are passed on directly to [rabbit-chatter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rabbit-chatter). So have a look at that module to see the rest of the option list.

### level

String

Default: 'info'

Sets the minimum required level for sending the log to RabbitMQ. You can find the levels [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/winston#logging-levels).

### formatter

function

Default: See below

Sets the standard formatter for the message. If no function is passed in this option, it will use the default-formatter which looks like this:

For versions: `<=1.2.4`
```javascript
function(level, meta, message)
{
    return JSON.stringify({ level: level, meta: meta, message: message  });
};
```

For versions: `>1.2.4`
```javascript
function(options)
{
    return JSON.stringify({ level: options.level, meta: options.meta, message: options.message  });
};
```
Thanks to Thomas from ebuildy for this contribution :-)


# Tests

To run tests on this module, make sure that the modules for the tests are installed

```
	npm install winston-fast-rabbitmq --dev
```

Then run:

```
	npm test
```

NOTICE: The test is not only a unit test but also a functionality test. So RabbitMQ is required to be installed locally in order to run the test.
